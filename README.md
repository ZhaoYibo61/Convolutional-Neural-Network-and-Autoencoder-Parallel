# Convolutional-Neural-Network-and-Autoencoder-Parallel
Here, we are proposing the novel architecture as the parallel version of both Convolutional Neural Networks and Autoencoders. We have applied this architecture for Emotion Detection Using Facial Expressions application. Here, We have used JAFFE (Japanese Female Facial Expressions) dataset to train the network.
